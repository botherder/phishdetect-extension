# PhishDetect Extension

This is a browser extension for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. It is a client for PhishDetect and it is currently capable of the following functionality:

- It regularly fetches a list of bad indicators from the configured PhishDetect Node.
- It blocks any visits to websites whose domains match a known indicator (inspired by the [Blockade](https://github.com/blockadeio) project).
- It integrates in various supported webmails. Everytime an email is opened it checks for known bad senders as well as known bad links inside the body.
- It modifies the links contained in the body in order to display a dialog prompt that offers the user the possibility of scanning the links with PhishDetect.
- It creates a button in the webmails' web interface to allow to share the full source email with the Node operators.
- It creates context menus and a toolbar button that allow to either send a link or directly the HTML content of the opened page to a PhishDetect backend in order to be scanned for phishing.
- It allows to scan the browsing history to identify visits to blocklisted domains.

Currently supported webmails:

- Gmail
- Roundcube
